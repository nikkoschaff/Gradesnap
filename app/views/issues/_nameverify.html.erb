    Student name (from test sheet):

    <p>Welcome to the Answer Name page.  If you're here, then it means the name read from the sheet doesn't match any of your students in your records.</p>  
    <p>We've listed the students in the class of this assignment.  Select the student and click the "Done" button when everything is set.  If the student isn't listed you may need to
      <%= link_to 'Add a new student', :action => 'new', :controller => 'students' %>
    then return to this page to set things straight.</p>

    <p>Existing student?  Match up here</p>
    <%= render :partial => 'form-nameSelect' %>

    <p>New student?  Add the name here</p>
    <%= render :partial => 'form-nameAdd' %>
