            <h3 class="subhead">The Story...</h3> 
            <p class="boxText">Gradesnap started with one very simple idea. How can grading be faster?In early 2011, our co-founder, Nikko Schaff, was sitting down to take a midterm, noticing that the multiple-choice bubbles were extremely wide. When asking why, the professor explained that his answer key is the same sheet with the right answers cut out, so he can lay it over a student's sheet and count the right answers quickly. "Taking a picture and grading with an iPhone app might work too," Nikko thought out loud. Thinking no more of it, he took his test and left.</p>

            <p class="boxText">Two days later, upon coming into class, the professor approached Nikko and said, "Hey, yesterday I talked to five of my teacher-friends about the grading app idea, and we all want it!" That was more than enough to show him that teachers really wanted a simple way to grade their exams, so he formed a team to launch a company with one goal: to make teachers' lives better through software.</p>
