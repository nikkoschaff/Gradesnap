Gradesnap
=========

Gradesnap is a web-based teacher-utility and grading solution that serves teachers of all levels of technical proficiency. The site provides educational support through allowing teachers to upload multiple-choice tests and process the information from their pages. It also provides statistical output for easy digestion of bulk information. The site is divided into three main categories relating to the process of grading multiple choice tests: Grader, Gradebook, Statistics. 

The Grader section provides an easy and simple way for teachers to upload and process multiple choice tests. The process is linear and straight-forward; there is only one way through it. The process involves uploading images of multiple-choice tests and specifying where the information is to be organized under.

The Gradebook section is a user-friendly branch of the site that posts organized listings of grade data. The Gradebook should display information that is useful and necessary for the user to maintain complete oversight over their assembly of students, classes, and assignments. 

The Statistics section offers a clean and consistent interface through which a user can view and extract statistical information about their students, classes, and assignments. Items found under the Statistics branch may include graphs, plots, and lists of rendered information.
